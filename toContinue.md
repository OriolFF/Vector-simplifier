# Vector Editor Resize Feature - Current Status

## Current Implementation

We've implemented a resize feature for the vector editor that allows exporting SVG/XML files at different dimensions. The implementation includes:

1. A modal dialog with:
   - Size presets (24×24, 48×48, 512×512)
   - Custom width and height inputs
   - Aspect ratio maintenance checkbox
   - Export format options (SVG/XML working, PNG/WebP UI only)

2. SVG resize functionality:
   - Clones the current SVG element
   - Sets new width/height attributes while preserving viewBox
   - Serializes to string with XML declaration
   - Creates downloadable file with size suffix in filename

## Current Issue

The main issue we're facing is with the filename handling during export:
- The original filename is not being correctly preserved when exporting resized files
- The current approach stores the filename and file type as data attributes on the SVG element

## Implementation Details

### In script.js:
- We store the original filename and file type (svg/xml) as data attributes on the SVG element:
```javascript
// Store the original filename and file type as data attributes on the SVG element
if (originalFileName && container === modifiedContainer) {
    svgElement.setAttribute('data-original-filename', originalFileName);
    svgElement.setAttribute('data-file-type', originalFileType);
    console.log('Set data attributes - filename:', originalFileName, 'type:', originalFileType);
}
```

### In resize.js:
- We retrieve the filename and file type from the SVG element's data attributes
- We use the file type to determine the correct MIME type for the download
- We add a size suffix to the filename before the extension

### In tools.js:
- We have a simple click handler for the resize button that calls showResizeTool()

## Next Steps

1. Debug why the filename is not being correctly preserved:
   - Check if the data attributes are being correctly set on the SVG element
   - Verify the data attributes are being correctly read when exporting
   - Add more debugging to trace the filename through the process

2. Test with both SVG and XML files to ensure both work correctly

3. Once the filename issue is resolved, implement PNG and WebP export formats

## Files to Focus On

1. script.js - Where the original filename is stored and the SVG is displayed
2. resize.js - Contains the resize tool logic and export functionality
3. tools.js - Handles the resize button click event

## Debugging Tips

- Use browser console logs to trace the filename through the process
- Check the SVG element in the DOM inspector to verify data attributes
- Test with simple filenames to rule out special character issues
